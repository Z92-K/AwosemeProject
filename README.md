#Basic tutorial on React-native
 
#In this tutorial I am going to be using Expo to build a React-native app for iOS, Android,
#and web that allows you to share photos with your friends! 

#To make it more fun and ensure that what you're building works on the web and phone install Expo client app on your #iOS/Android mobile
#After saving your initial project you can scan the QR code using your device and test your latest changes
